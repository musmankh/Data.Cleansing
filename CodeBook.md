The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 

"Subject"                    =  No of Volunteer

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

"Activity"                   =  Name of Activities          


Features Explanation:

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ       = Body Accelaration Signals 

tGravityAcc-XYZ    = Gravity Accelaration Signals

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ   = Body linear Accelaration Jerk Signals

tBodyGyro-XYZ      = Body angular Velocity signals

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  = Body angular Velocity Jerk Signals

tBodyAccMag        = Magnitude of Body Accelaration Signals

tGravityAccMag     = Magnitude of Gravity Accelaration Signals

tBodyAccJerkMag    = MAgnitude of Body linear accelaration Jerk Signals

tBodyGyroMag       = MAgnitude of body angular velocity signals

tBodyGyroJerkMag   = Magnitude of body angular velocity jerk signals

fBodyAcc-XYZ       = Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) application on Body accelaration signals

fBodyAccJerk-XYZ   = FFT application on Body linear accelaration jerk signals

fBodyGyro-XYZ      = FFT application on Body angular velocity signals

fBodyAccMag        = FFT application on Magnitude of Body accelaration signals

fBodyAccJerkMag    = FFT appliation on Magnitude of Body linear accelaration jerk signals

fBodyGyroMag       = FFT application on Magnitude of body angular velocity signals 

fBodyGyroJerkMag   = FFT application on Magnitude of body angular velocity jerk signals


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value

std():  Standard deviation

Data Set 2:

In data set two Mean of each variable is given for each activity and volunteer.

Notes: 

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
